## About The Project

Python program that scrapes Amazon price data and alerts the user through email if their speicifed item's price falls. <br />
In 2020, Amazon updated their site and the Requests + BeautifulSoup libraries no longer work for scraping site data.
However, the Requests-HTML library was one of the methods that I found to work as of December 2020. 


### Built With
